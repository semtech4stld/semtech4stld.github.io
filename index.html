                    <!--<p>The rapid growth of online available scientific, technical, and legal data such as patents, technical reports, articles, etc.  has made the large-scale analysis and processing of such documents a crucial task.

                    <p>In order to benefit from the scientific-technical knowledge present in such documents, it has become critical that the communities related to Semantic Technologies, NLP, and Deep Learning join their forces to provide more effective and efficient solutions. This workshop, aims to provide a venue for researchers and practitioners to foster inter-disciplinary research in the areas of Semantic Technologies, NLP and Deep Learning. </p>-->

                    <p>The rapid growth of online available scientific, technical, and legal data such as patents, reports, articles, etc. has made the large-scale analysis and processing of such data a crucial task. Today, scientists, patent experts, inventors, and other information professionals (e.g., information scientists, lawyers, etc.) contribute to this data every day by publishing articles, writing technical reports, or patent applications.</p>

                    <p>It is a challenging task to process, analyze, and explore documents due to their length, the use of domain-specific vocabulary, and the complexity introduced by targeting various scientific fields and domains. Documents are semi-structured and cover unstructured textual parts as well as structured parts such as tables, mathematical formulas, diagrams, and domain-specific information such as chemical names, bio-sequences, etc.</p>

                    <p>Such kind of information brings complexity in processing such documents; however, data is the lifeblood of many applications, and its preservation, analysis, enrichment, and use are key for applications in several domains. In order to benefit from the scientific-technical knowledge present in such documents, e.g., for decision-making or for professional search and analytics, there is an urgent need for analyzing, enriching, and linking such data by employing state-of-the-art Semantic Web technologies and AI methods.</p>

                    <p>However, as they are heterogeneous and are written using domain-specific terminology applying the existing semantic technologies is not straightforward. To address the challenges mentioned above, Semantic Web Technologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and Large Language Models (LLMs) must be leveraged in order to provide efficient and effective solutions for creating easily accessible and machine-understandable knowledge.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">Submission</h3>
                <p>The submissions must be in English and adhere to the <a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/">CEUR-WS one-column template</a> (see Session 2: The New CEURART Style). The papers should be submitted as PDF files to <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=semtech4stld24">EasyChair</a>. The review process will be single-blind. Please be aware that at least one author per paper must be registered and attend the workshop to present the work and that ESWC is a 100% in person conference. </p>

                <p>We will consider three different submission types:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>Full Research Papers (8-12 pages)</strong> should be clearly placed with respect to the state of the art and state the contribution of the proposal in the domain of application, even if presenting preliminary results. In particular, research papers should describe the methodology in detail, experiments should be repeatable, and a comparison with the existing approaches in the literature is encouraged. </li> 

                    <li> <strong>Short Papers (5-7 pages)</strong> should describe significant novel work in progress. Compared to full papers, their contribution may be narrower in scope, be applied to a narrower set of application domains, or have weaker empirical support than that expected for a full paper. Submissions likely to generate discussions in new and emerging areas of legal data are encouraged.</li> 

                    <li> <strong>Position or Industry Papers (3-5 pages)</strong> should introduce new point of views in the workshop topics or summarize the experience of a group in the field.</li> 

		     <li><strong>Extended Abstracts (1-2 pages) </strong> should introduce an ongoing work that aligns with the main scope of the workshop.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Submissions should not exceed the indicated number of pages, including any diagrams and references.</p>

                <p>Each submission will be reviewed by three independent reviewers on the basis of relevance for the workshop, novelty/originality, significance, technical quality and correctness, quality and clarity of presentation, quality of references and reproducibility.</p>
    
                <p>The accepted papers will be available on the Workshop website. The proceedings will be published in a CEUR-WS volume and consequently indexed on Google Scholar, DBLP, and Scopus.</p>

							<strong>Keynote and Q&A</strong> on <strong> Making legal knowledge accessible to machines: challenges and opportunities</strong></br></br>
							<p><strong>Speaker</strong>: <a href="https://sentic.net/erikcambria/">Dr. Sabrina Kirrane</a>, Vienna University of Economics and Business Institute for Information Systems and New Media.  <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zn7IJCxv0H7hnNrv33sp0Mum7e1jMIlC/view?usp=sharing">  SLIDES</a></strong> </p>
							
                            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract</strong>: This talk explores automated techniques for making legal knowledge pertaining to both legislation and court cases accessible to machines.
 
                            First, we introduce a legal knowledge graph creation methodology that can be used to transform structured and unstructured legal data into legal knowledge graphs that can be easily linked across different EU member states. Our knowledge graph, which is strongly routed
                            in the ELI and ECLI standardisation initiatives, is populated with data and metadata from the Austrian legal information system and concepts automatically extracted from Austrian legal documents.
                            Second, we examine the particularities of temporal annotation in the legal domain, including the different court case decision structures adopted by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the United States Supreme Court (USC). We are especially interested in misleading or mistaken temporal expressions in references; and deficiencies in the TimeML temporal annotation standard when it comes to specific legal temporal expressions.
                            Third, we perform a comparison of different approaches to automatically extract events and their components (i.e., who; did what; when). The comparative analysis is performed over a set of 30 decisions from the ECHR that were manually annotated by two legal experts. We subsequently used the gold standard to compare the performance of various event extraction tools: rule-based, probability-based, and deep learning based.
                            </p>

                            Systems (Semantics). Sabrina has also participated in various Dagstuhl
                            seminars focusing on Federated Semantic Data Management, Normative
                            Multi-Agent Systems; Knowledge Graphs: New Directions for Knowledge
                            Representation on the Semantic Web; and Autonomous Agents on the Web.

                            Her research primarily focuses on data and algorithmic governance (e.g.,
                            access constraints, usage policies, regulatory obligations, societal
                            norms, trust and transparency mechanisms), legal informatics,
                            decentralised applications, and intelligent software web agents.</p>
