                    <h3 class="section-title">Aims and Scope</h3>

                    <p>The exponential increase in scientific, technical, and legal data available on the Web, including research articles, patents, standards, and technical reports, has made their large-scale semantic processing, interlinking, and knowledge extraction a central challenge for the Web community. These data sources are heterogeneous, semi-structured, and domain-specific, containing complex elements such as text, tables, equations, and diagrams that make traditional data integration and analysis difficult. Yet, they hold immense potential for advancing knowledge discovery, open science, and evidence-based innovation. As the Web evolves into a vast ecosystem of human- and machine-generated content, there is a growing need to develop scalable AI models and semantic interoperable representations that transform this fragmented information into interconnected, machine-interpretable knowledge..</p>

                    <p>In this context, the SemTech 2026 workshop focuses on methods that combine Semantic Web technologies, Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs), and other AI technologies to model knowledge across scientific, technical, and legal domains. The workshop invites research on knowledge graph creation, semantic annotation, LLM–KG hybrid reasoning, and trustworthy AI pipelines that enhance the reliability, interpretability, and reuse of Web data. This is particularly timely as the Web community seeks robust approaches to integrate symbolic and sub-symbolic methods for managing and understanding the growing body of domain-specific knowledge on the Web.</p>

The papers should be submitted as PDF files to <b><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=semtech4stld25">EasyChair</a></b>. The review process will be single-blind. Please be aware that at least one author per paper must be registered and attend the workshop to present the work and that ESWC is a 100% in person conference. </p>-->

                <p> Submissions must be in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM template and format </a> (also available in <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty">Overleaf</a>). Word users may use the Word Interim Template and the recommended setting for LaTeX is: \documentclass[sigconf, anonymous, review]{acmart}. </p>

                <p>We will consider two different submission types:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>Full Research Papers (8 pages maximum) </strong>, should be clearly placed with respect to the state of the art and state the contribution of the proposal in the domain of application, even if presenting preliminary results. In particular, research papers should describe the methodology in detail, experiments should be repeatable, and a comparison with the existing approaches in the literature is encouraged. </li> 

                    <li> <strong>Short Papers (4 pages maximum)</strong>, should describe significant novel work in progress. Compared to full papers, their contribution may be narrower in scope, be applied to a narrower set of application domains, or have weaker empirical support than that expected for a full paper. Submissions likely to generate discussions in new and emerging areas of legal data are encouraged.</li> 

                </ul>

                <p>Submissions should not exceed the indicated number of pages, including any diagrams and references.</p>

                <p>The ACM has an <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship">authorship policy</a> stating who can be considered an author in a submission as well as the use of generative AI tools. </p>

                <p> <b>Important update on ACM's new open access publishing model for 2026 ACM Conferences! </b> Starting January 1, 2026, ACM will fully transition to Open Access. All ACM publications, including those from ACM-sponsored conferences, will be 100% Open Access. Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access articles with ACM: the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article Processing Charges (APCs). With over <a href="https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/open-participants">2,700+ institutions</a> already part of ACM Open with more institutions joining from around the world every week, the majority of ACM-sponsored conference papers will not require APCs from authors or conferences.
                <b>Authors from institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an APC to publish their papers ($250 APC for ACM/SIG members, $350 for non-members).</b></p>

                <p>Each submission will be reviewed by three independent reviewers on the basis of relevance for the workshop, novelty/originality, significance, technical quality and correctness, quality and clarity of presentation, quality of references and reproducibility.</p>

							<strong>Keynote and Q&A</strong> on <strong> Evaluation Challenges in Using Generative AI for Science & Technical Content </strong></br></br>
							<p><strong>Speaker</strong>: <a href="https://pgroth.com/">Prof. Dr. Paul Groth</a> </br> INDE Lab, University of Amsterdam
							
                            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Foundation Models show impressive results in a wide-range of tasks on scientific and legal content from information extraction to question answering and even literature synthesis. However, standard evaluation approaches (e.g. comparing to ground truth) often do not seem to work. Qualitatively the results look great but quantitive scores do not align with these observations. In this talk, I discuss the challenges we have faced in our lab in evaluation. I then outline potential routes forward. 
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Short Bio</strong>: Paul Groth is Professor of Algorithmic Data Science at the University of Amsterdam where he leads the Intelligent Data Engineering Lab (INDElab).

                            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Creating intelligent applications that valorise complex domain data such as in the scientific, technical, and legal domain often calls for solutions that combine learning and symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) methods. In line with such developments, in the first part of this talk, we focus on describing a new sub-area of AI that focuses on combining Machine Learning components with techniques developed by the Semantic Web community—Semantic Web Machine Learning (SWeML). We report on the results of a systematic mapping study during which we analysed nearly 500 papers published in the past decade in this area, where we focused on evaluating architectural and application-specific features of such systems. In the second part of the talk, we describe the development and evaluation of a concrete SWeML system that aims to extract key elements from official Austrian permits, including the Issuing Authority, the Operator of the facility in question, the Reference Number, and the Issuing Date. We hope that our lessons learned both about this area as a whole (through the survey of SWeML systems) and the concrete system we built will provide inspiration for researchers and practitioners working with such complex data as in the legal domain and beyond.

                            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Short Bio</strong>: Prof. Dr. Marta Sabou is a professor for Information Systems and Business Engineering at  the Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU) and the Head of Institute for Data, Process and Knowledge Management (DPKM). She holds  a PhD in Artificial Intelligence from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, for which she won the IEEE Intelligent System’s Ten to Watch Award in 2006. During her career, she performed Artificial Intelligence (AI) research as Research Fellow at the Open University UK, Assistant Professor at MODUL University Vienna, Key Expert in Semantic Technologies at Siemens and FWF Elise-Richter Fellow at the Vienna University of Technology. </br></br>

                            Prof. Sabou leads the Semantic Systems research group, which performs foundational and applied research at the intersection of the  Semantic Web, Machine Learning and Human Computation research areas. Her group’s research topics range from knowledge engineering (knowledge graphs and their evaluation, data integration) to the development of novel intelligent systems that combine both symbolic and sub-symbolic AI techniques, i.e., neuro-symbolic systems.  This foundational research underpins an active involvement in applied research in terms of developing advanced functionalities (e.g., system explainability and auditability) in application areas ranging from tourism and cultural heritage to mission critical domains enabled by complex  cyber-physical (social) systems such as smart grids, smart buildings, smart factories (as part of Industry 4.0-5.0). Increasingly, the group addresses topics in the area of Digital Humanism such as the auditing of AI systems and the involvement of human stakeholders in the design of intelligent systems. Prof. Sabou is an accomplished academic (close to 150 peer-reviewed papers, h-index 46) and takes an active role in the Semantic Web research community  as an editorial board member for two journals (SWJ, NAI) and conference organiser.
